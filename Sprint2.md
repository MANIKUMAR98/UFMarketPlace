# Sprint 2

## Details of Work Completed in Sprint 2

- Created an API to send OTP for email verification.
- Updated database with expiration time each time an OTP is sent.
-  Used **SendGrid** to send OTP emails to users for verification. 
- Created an API to validate the OTP entered by the user and check if it has expired.
- Integrated Forntend and Backend by using CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).
- Implemented endpoints to retrieve listings: one endpoint returns all listings excluding those created by the current user, and another returns only the listings of the current user.
- Integrated CRUD operations for product listings, including creating, updating (with full image replacement when new images are provided), and deleting listings along with their associated images.
- Images are stored in the database as binary data and are returned as base64-encoded strings to allow direct rendering on the frontend.

## User Stories (Backend)

**US-024**: As a user, I would want only students in the university to view and sell items in the UFMarket place, so email verification through a One-Time Password (OTP) is required.
**US-025**: As a user, if I have not verified my email through OTP, I should not be allowed to log in to the portal.
**US-026**: As a verified user, I want to create a new product listing with images so that I can sell my items on UFMarketPlace.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - The user must be authenticated (with a valid session) and have a verified email.
  - The `POST /listings` endpoint accepts multipart form data including fields:
    - `productName`, `productDescription`, `price`, `category`
    - One or more image files under the key `images`
  - The listing is saved in the database along with the images (which are stored in binary form and returned as base64 strings).
  - The API response returns all listings for the current user including the new one.

**US-027**: As a user, I want to view all product listings except my own so that I can browse items available from other sellers.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - The `GET /listings` endpoint returns listings that do not belong to the current user.
  - The request requires a `userId` header indicating the current userâ€™s ID.
  - The response includes complete listing details along with associated images (base64 encoded).

**US-028**: As a user, I want to view all my own product listings so that I can manage my items for sale.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - The `GET /userListings` endpoint returns only listings created by the current user.
  - The request requires a `userId` header.

**US-029**: As a user, I want to edit my existing product listing (including updating images) so that I can update or correct my listing information.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - The `PUT /listing/edit` endpoint allows updating listing fields (`productName`, `productDescription`, `price`, `category`).
  - New images provided will replace all existing images for that listing.
  - The endpoint verifies that the listing belongs to the current user (using the `userId` header).
  - The API returns a success message upon successful update.

**US-030**: As a user, I want to delete my product listing so that I can remove items that are no longer available.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - The `DELETE /listing/delete` endpoint allows the user to delete a listing.
  - The listing is identified via a query parameter (`listingId`), and the request includes the `userId` header.
  - All images associated with the listing are also removed from the database.
  - A success message is returned once the deletion is complete.

# OTPVerification Component Test Documentation

This file contains unit tests for the `OTPVerification` component. The component is responsible for verifying the OTP (One-Time Password) entered by the user. These tests simulate user interactions, validate the OTP functionality, and check the correct behavior of the component.

## Dependencies

- `@testing-library/react`: Provides utilities for testing React components.
- `jest`: Used for mocking functions, running tests, and handling assertions.
- `react-router-dom`: Used for routing-related functionality, like navigation and path management.
- `authService`: A mocked module that simulates API calls for sending and verifying OTPs.

## Mocked Functions

- **`jest.mock("../AuthService")`**: Mock the `authService` module's functions:
  - `sendEmailVerificationCode`: Mocked to simulate the action of sending an OTP code to the userâ€™s email.
  - `verifyEmailVerificationCode`: Mocked to simulate the action of verifying the OTP entered by the user.

- **`jest.mock("react-router-dom")`**: Mock `useNavigate` to simulate navigation between routes.

## Test Setup

- **`beforeEach`**: Clears all mocks and sets an email (`test@ufl.edu`) in sessionStorage to simulate the stored email used in the component.
  
- **`afterEach`**: Clears sessionStorage after each test to ensure tests do not affect one another.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. **Rendering OTPVerification and Sending OTP on Mount**
   - **Purpose**: Ensures that when the `OTPVerification` component is mounted, the email address is displayed and the `sendEmailVerificationCode` function is called.

     - Verify that the email is displayed.
     - Confirm that `sendEmailVerificationCode` is called.

### 2. **Shows Resend Timer and Hides Resend Button Initially**

   - **Test Steps**:
     - Render the component.
     - Check if the timer text is visible.
     - Ensure the resend button does not appear initially.

### 3. **Enabling and Submitting OTP after Entering 6 Digits**
   - **Purpose**: Confirms that the "Verify OTP" button is enabled once all 6 digits are entered, and when clicked, the OTP is sent for verification.
   - **Test Steps**:
     - Render the component.
     - Enter digits into the OTP input fields.
     - Verify that the "Verify OTP" button is enabled.
     - Simulate submitting the OTP and check that `verifyEmailVerificationCode` is called with the entered code.

### 4. **Error on Invalid OTP (Not 6 Digits)**
   - **Purpose**: Verifies that an error is displayed if the user tries to submit the OTP without entering 6 digits.
   - **Test Steps**:
     - Render the component.
     - Attempt to submit without entering 6 digits.
     - Check that no API call is made.

### 5. **Displaying Error from verifyEmailVerificationCode**
   - **Purpose**: Tests that an error message is shown when the OTP verification fails.
   - **Test Steps**:
     - Render the component and enter 6 digits.
     - Simulate an API error (`Invalid code`).
     - Ensure that the error message appears on the screen and no navigation occurs.

### 6. **Resend OTP After Timer Expiration**
   - **Purpose**: Confirms that the "Resend OTP" button appears after the 60-second countdown ends, and that clicking it triggers the `sendEmailVerificationCode` function.
   - **Test Steps**:
     - Render the component and simulate the passage of 60 seconds using Jest's fake timers.
     - Ensure the "Resend OTP" button appears after the countdown ends.
     - Simulate a click on the button and verify the API call to resend the OTP.

### 7. **Navigating Back to Login**
   - **Purpose**: Verifies that the "Return to Login" button navigates the user back to the login page.
   - **Test Steps**:
     - Render the component.
     - Simulate a click on the "Return to Login" button.
     - Ensure that `mockNavigate` is called with `/login`.

## Test Utilities

- **`render`**: Renders the component into the DOM for testing.
- **`screen`**: Provides access to the rendered component and allows querying elements.
- **`fireEvent`**: Simulates user interactions like typing and clicking.
- **`waitFor`**: Waits for asynchronous operations to complete.
- **`act`**: Used to simulate actions that cause state changes.

## Mocked API Responses

- **`sendEmailVerificationCode`**: Mocked to resolve successfully when the OTP is initially sent or resent.
- **`verifyEmailVerificationCode`**: Mocked to resolve or reject based on the success or failure of OTP verification.

## Error Handling

- If the OTP is not 6 digits or verification fails, appropriate error messages are displayed, and navigation does not occur until the OTP is successfully verified.
