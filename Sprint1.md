# Sprint 1 - Frontend

## User Stories

1. **As a user, I want to be able to sign up for an account so that I can access the features of the application.**
2. **As a user, I want to be able to log in to my account using my credentials so that I can access my personal dashboard.**

## Issues Planned to Address

1. **Design and implement the Signup Form UI**:

   - Create a user-friendly signup form where users can enter their information, such as email, password, and password confirmation.

2. **Design and implement the Login Form UI**:

   - Create a simple and intuitive login form that allows users to enter their credentials to access their account.

3. **Add front-end validation for both forms**:

   - Implement validation for user input:
     - Email format validation.
     - Password strength validation.
     - Password match validation for the signup form.
     - Appropriate error messages for invalid inputs.

4. **Make forms responsive for mobile devices**:
   - Ensure that both the signup and login forms work well on mobile devices, with proper alignment and responsive design.
