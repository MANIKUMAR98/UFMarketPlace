# Sprint 1 Report

## User Stories

### Authentication & Routing

1. **US-001**: As a user, I want to log in with email/password to access protected dashboard features
2. **US-002**: As a user, I want to sign up for a new account to access the application
3. **US-003**: As an unauthenticated user, I should be redirected to login when trying to access /dashboard
4. **US-004**: As a logged-in user, I want to stay authenticated between page refreshes
5. **US-005**: As a user, I want clear error messages for invalid login/signup attempts

## Planned Issues

1. Implement protected route component ([#101])
2. Create authentication form with animated inputs ([#102])
3. Add session persistence using browser storage ([#103])
4. Configure API service with axios interceptors ([#104])
5. Implement loading states and error handling ([#105])

## Key Technical Decisions

1. Chose sessionStorage over localStorage for better security isolation
2. Implemented route protection using React Router v6 Outlet pattern
3. Used react-spring for form animations to enhance UX
4. Adopted axios interceptors for consistent API error handling

## Next Steps

1. Implement session expiration logic (Sprint 2)
2. Add password reset functionality (Sprint 2)
3. Improve loading states with skeleton screens (Sprint 2)
