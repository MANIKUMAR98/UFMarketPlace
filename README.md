# UFMarketplace  

Problem Statement:
----
The University of Florida currently lacks a university-specific online marketplace where students and staff can post, browse, and connect with each other to buy or sell products. Existing solutions like social media groups and bulletin boards are unstructured, inefficient, and often pose trust and security challenges. A dedicated platform is needed to streamline these transactions while fostering a trusted community environment where users can connect easily and securely.

About:
----
UFMarketplace is a web-based platform exclusively designed for the University of Florida community, enabling students and staff to post and browse product listings. Built with Golang for the backend and Angular 17.0.5 for the frontend, the platform provides a simple and secure way for users to showcase items for sale and connect with potential buyers or sellers.
